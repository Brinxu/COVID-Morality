    "With eMFDScore, you have several options to extract moral information metrics from texutal corpora.   \n",
    "Below, we go over these options one by one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When scoring documents with the extended Moral Foundations Dicitonary (eMFD; default in eMFDScore),  \n",
    "you must decide how you would like to use the eMFD for scoring textual documents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, in the eMFD, every of the 3020 words is assigned the following scores: \n",
    "- `Foundation Probabilities`: Each word is assigned 5 probabalities that denote the likelihood  \n",
    "that this word is associated with each one of the five moral foundations as identified by Moral  \n",
    "Foundations  Theory. For example, the word \"kill\" has a care probability of 0.4 and  \n",
    "a loyalty probability of 0.24, meaning that there is a 40% chance that a coder highlighted a context in which the word \"kill\" appeared  \n",
    "with the care-harm foundation and a 24% chance that this context was highlighted with the loyalty-betrayal foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Sentiment Scores`: Each word is assigned 5 sentiment scores that denote the average sentiment  \n",
    "of the foundation context in which this word appeared. For example, the word \"kill\" has an average  \n",
    "\"care_sent\" of -0.69, meaning that all \"care-harm\" highlights in which \"kill\" appeared had an average,  \n",
    "negative sentiment of -0.69.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these scores, there are two options how these scores can be \"mapped\" when scoring a  \n",
    "document (flag `prob_map` below):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `all` probabilities per word in the eMFD (option `all`):  \n",
    "=> Using all five foundation probabilities assumes that each word is used as an indicator for multiple foundations with the probabilities as weights. \n",
    "2. Assign a `single`  probability to each word in the eMFD according to the foundation with the highest  probability (option `single`):  \n",
    "=> Each word only indicates **one** foundation (the one with the highest foundation probability) and each time this word is found  \n",
    "the respective foundation is increased by that word's foundation probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can decide whether you want eMFDScore to return the average sentiment for each  \n",
    "foundation, or whether you would like eMFDScore to split each foundation  \n",
    "into a `vice` and `virtue`  category (flag `output_metrics` below):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Return the average `sentiment ` for each foundation (option `sentiment`) \n",
    "2. Split foundations into a `vice-virtue` category (option `vice-virtue`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The vice-virtue split is accomplished by considering the average sentiment of each foundation of each  \n",
    "word, and then assigning this word to \"virtue\" if the foundation sentiment is positive,  \n",
    "or to \"vice\" if the sentiment is negative.  \n",
    "For instance, if using the `all` option for the `prob_map` option above, a word's foundation probabilities  \n",
    "will be translated into five `virtue` scores (e.g., care, fairness,  loyalty, authority, and sanctity)   \n",
    "if the word's sentiment for these foundations is positive, whereas a word  whose sentiments for each  \n",
    "foundation is negative will be assigned five `vice` scores (e.g., harm, cheating,  betrayal, subversion, and degradation). \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above, there is a total of 4 different options how the eMFD can be used.  \n",
    "The specific usage of each and use case is explicated below. "

    "- [INPUT_FILE]: = The path to a CSV file in which the first column contains the document texts to be scored.  \n",
    "  Each row should reflect its own document. See the template_input.csv for an example file format.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- [OUTPUT_FILE] = Specifies the file name of the generated output csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SCORING_METHOD] = Currently, eMFDscore employs three different scoring algorithms:\n",
    "    - `bow` is a classical Bag-of-Words approach in which the algorithm simply searches for word matches between document texts and the specified dictionary.\n",
    "    - `pat` (in development) relies on named entity recognition and syntactic dependency parsing. For each document, the algorithm first extracts all mentioned entities.  \n",
    "    Next, for each entitiy, eMFDscore extracts words that pertain to 1) moral verbs for which the entity is an agent argument (Agent verbs), 2) moral verbs for  \n",
    "    which the entity is the patient, theme, or other argument (Patient verbs), and other moral attributes (i.e., adjectival modifiers, appositives, etc.).\n",
    "    - `wordlist` is a simple scoring algorithm that lets users examine the moral content of individual words. This scoring method expects a CSV where each row corresponds  \n",
    "    to a unique word. Note: The wordlist scoring algorithm does not perform any tokenization or preprocessing on the wordlists.   \n",
    "    For a more fine-grained moral content extraction, users are encouraged to use either the bow or path methodology. Furthermore, only the emfd is currenlty supported for PAT extraction.   \n",
    "    Additionally, this method is more computationally expensive and thus has a longer execution time.\n",
    "    - `gdelt.ngrams` is designed for the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone Television Ngram dataset.   \n",
    "    This scoring method expects a unigram (1gram) input text file from GDELT and will score each unprocessed (untokenized) unigram with the eMFD.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- [DICTIONARY_TYPE] = Declares which dictionary is applied to score documents. In its current version, eMFDscore lets users choose between three dictionaries:\n",
    "    - `emfd` = extended Moral Foundations Dictionary (eMFD)\n",
    "    - `mfd2` = Moral Foundations Dicitonary 2.0 (Frimer et al., 2017; https://osf.io/xakyw/ )\n",
    "    - `mfd` = original Moral Foundations Dictionary (https://moralfoundations.org/othermaterials)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- When choosing the eMFD; the following two additional flags need to be defined:\n",
    "    - [PROB_MAP]: How are the foundation probabilities mapped when scoring a document? \n",
    "        - `all` : use all probabilities per word in the eMFD\n",
    "        - `single`: Assign a single probability to each word in the eMFD according to the foundation with the highest probability\n",
    "           \n",
    "    - [OUTPUT_METRICS]: Which metrics are returned? \n",
