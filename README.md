# COVIED MORALITY

### Introduction

This repository includes code and trained models corresponding to our research paper on covid morality. This paper explores the relationship between morality and audience engagement to Covid-19 related issues. We generated a liberty dictionary and then generate post level liberty score. This allows us to quantify liberty morality, which is missing in the extended moral foundation dictionary (eMFDs).

### Install
We used the Anaconda navigator to run the python notebook (version: 6.4.8). No other software is needed to run the code.
