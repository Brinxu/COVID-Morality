## COVID MORALITY

### Introduction

This repository includes code and trained models corresponding to our research paper on covid morality. This paper explores the relationship between morality and audience engagement to Covid-19 related issues. We generated a liberty dictionary and then generate post level liberty score. This allows us to quantify liberty morality, which is missing in the extended moral foundation dictionary (eMFDs). 

An ealier version of this research has been prestend at the ICA conference at Pairs, France (Virtual).
